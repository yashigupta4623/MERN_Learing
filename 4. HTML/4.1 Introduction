**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the backbone of every webpage. It defines the structure of web content using a system of elements represented by tags.

A **basic HTML boilerplate** looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Elements in the Boilerplate:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**  
   Declares the document type as HTML5. It ensures the browser interprets the document correctly.

2. **`<html lang="en">`**  
   The root element of the HTML document. The `lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the content (English in this case).

3. **`<head>`**  
   Contains metadata about the webpage, such as its title, character encoding, and other settings.

   - **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**  
     Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, which supports most characters used worldwide.
     
   - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**  
     Makes the webpage responsive by ensuring it scales properly on all devices, especially mobile.

   - **`<title>`**  
     Sets the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.

4. **`<body>`**  
   The main content of the webpage goes here. Elements within the `<body>` are displayed in the browser.

   - **`<h1>`**  
     Defines the main heading of the page. Use headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to structure content hierarchically.
     
   - **`<p>`**  
     Represents a paragraph of text.

   - **`<a href="URL">`**  
     Creates a hyperlink. The `href` attribute specifies the destination URL.

### Why Use This Boilerplate?
This minimal setup ensures your webpage:
- Works on all modern browsers.
- Adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design).
- Uses proper character encoding to display text correctly.

From here, you can expand your webpage by adding more elements like images (`<img>`), lists (`<ul>`/`<ol>`), or div containers (`<div>`).
